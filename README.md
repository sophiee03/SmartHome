# Description
Our project is to create a smart house that can provide the following functionality:
- open the door of the house through pressing a button to enter, and vice versa, reopen it to leave in the same way
- exploit the light sensor to monitor the brightness of the house: it will turn on the lights if someone enters the house
- take advantage of the temperature sensor to open the windows if the temperature is high and close them if the temperature is low
- exploit the accelerometer to monitor the presence of earthquakes and signal it with door opening and alarm light
